Need for Spreed: Pro Street - Car customizer

Since DebugCarCustomize was cut from Pro Street, this tool aims to replace it and bring more.

Requirements:
-run as administrator
-.net framework 4.8

Features:
-change/remove body parts
-change car mode
-copy/paste car customization
-vinyl edit(move to vinyls/decals, choose speical vinyls etc)

To choose a car you need to enter its customization menu(to verify that you've choosed the right car you can see status message at the bottom of the tool).
Dont do any changes IN GAME, while youre working with the tool.
If you made changes in game you need to Update Blueprint before making changes in the tool, otherwise the tool probably will not affect a car.

Distribution:
You are NOT allowed to distribute or reupload this mod.
